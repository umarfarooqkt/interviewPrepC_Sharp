Write a C# console application that reads a .txt or .csv (you choose) file containing a list of numbers: 
 
11, 22, 1, 34, 2, 3, 10, 333. 
 
The numbers in the file can each be comma-separated or separated by new line, you choose. 
 
Support command-line arguments so that the user will be able to specify the following options: -File to read from. -Sort direction -Number detection sort (e.g. 1 < 2 < 11 < 22), pure string sort (1 < 11 < 2 < 22), or hybrid sorting (22 < 2 < 1 < 11) even descending and then odd ascending 
 
The program should output the sorted result to the console window. 
 
Provide the solution as just .cs code files or as a visual studio solution.
